DKP, short for “<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Dragon_Kill_Points">Dragon Kills Points</a>”, is a method of rewarding items to players in game based on their contribution. In general, users receive ‘DKP Points’ whenever they participate in raid or help the guild. They can then ‘spend’ these points when items drop during raids to purchase them. In this way, players who consistently help the guild can fairly earn items.

WebDKP is a free system that helps manage your Guilds DKP and makes your life much easier. It has two parts: an in game Addon for awarding and viewing DKP, and this site that allows you to share your DKP table online. The site and Addon are easy to use and can literally save hours of work.
